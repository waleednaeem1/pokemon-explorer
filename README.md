# Pokemon Explorer

Pokemon Explorer is a web application that allows users to explore and view information about different Pokémon. Users can browse a list of Pokémon, view their details, and learn more about each one.

## Features

- **Pokemon List**: Browse a list of Pokémon, including their names and images.
- **Pokemon Details**: View detailed information about each Pokémon, such as their height, weight, and image.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Navigate between the Pokemon List and Pokemon Details pages seamlessly without page refresh.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Used for client-side routing to enable navigation between different pages of the application.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Manages application state, including API data fetching and caching.
- **PokeAPI**: An external RESTful API used to fetch data about Pokémon.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-explorer.git

2. `npm install`

3. ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
